# DNN-Optimizer

This code is the result of my graduation work entitled "Approche hybride de compression logicielle de réseaux de neurones profonds : Application à la classification d'images, détection d'objets et surveillance de chantiers ferroviaires" (Hybrid Approach for Software Compression of Deep Neural Networks: Application to Image Classification, Object Detection, and Railway Construction Site Monitoring).

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/samybakk/DNN-Optimizer.git
$ cd DNN-Optimizer
$ pip install requirements.txt
```
To optimize a Yolov5 neural network, you will also need to run the following commands :
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git
$ git clone https://github.com/wonbeomjang/yolov5-knowledge-distillation.git
```

Finally, to launch the program, you can use this command line :
```bash
$ python Scripts/main_interface.py 
```

Please note that this program requires additional dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file. Make sure to install them before running the code.
